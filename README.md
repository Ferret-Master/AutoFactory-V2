Autofactory V2 by FerretMaster

Modified autofactory by TrialQ to improve and change it

Removed Features:

 - Power settings per factory, power is now ignored when auto queuing
 
 

New Features:

 - Much more powerfull unit queuing by expanding the feature from 1 unit to any length of complex queue

 - Settings tab that lets you set the queue for each factory
 
 - Support for every unit
 
 - setting that lets you specify how far into the game you want it to start(won't work well with disconnects with the way the timer is implemented)
 
 Fixed Bugs:
 
 - Fixed t1 units getting queued in t2 factorys


as with the original, highly recomended to use with the infinite build default mod

The default queues should be useable for most players, but you can make your own custom ones via settings.
