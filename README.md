Autofactory V2 by FerretMaster

Modified autofactory by TrialQ to improve and change it

Removed Features:

 - Power settings per factory, power is now ignored when auto queuing
 
 - Settings per factory ingame for a unit/power

New Features:

 - Much more powerfull unit queuing by expanding the feature from 1 unit to any length of complex queue that is currently set in file

 - Settings button to switch between custom and default queues in file, removed clutter of previous settings

 - Custom queues via file editing(commented well for accessibility) atm but will add in settings later


as with the other mod, highly recomended to use with the infinite build default mod

The default queues should be useable for most players, but you can make your own custom ones with minimal effort and a text editor.


Making a custom queue: Navigate through the folder the mod comes in "improved autofactory\ui\mods\Autofactory\live_game" 
		       and open init.js with a text editor. A bit less than halfway down the file the process of custom
		       queues is described via comments fairly extensivley.

For those that choose not to customise the default queues are as follows:


	BOT_FAC = 5 dox, 2 sparks

	ADVANCED_BOT_FAC = 3 slammers, 1 bluehawk, 1 GIl-E

	VEHICLE_FAC = 3 ants, 2 infernos, 1 spinner, 1 skitter, 2 ants

	ADVANCED_VEHICLE_FAC = 3 levelers, 2 shellers, 3 levellers, 3 shellers, 1 storm

	AIR_FAC = 1 priority firefly, 2 hummingbird, 1 bumblebee, 2 hummingbird

	ADVANCED_AIR_FAC = 2 phoenix, 2 kestrel, 1 horsefly

	NAVAL_FAC : 1 Orca, 2 barracudas, 1 narwhal

	ADVANCED_NAVAL_FAC : 1 priority built typhoon, 2 krakens, 1 leviathen

	ORBITAL_LAUNCHER: 10 avengers, 2 artemis

	ORBITAL_FACTORY: 1 avenger
