Autofactory V2 by FerretMaster

Modified autofactory by TrialQ to improve and change it

Icon by Marshall

Removed Features:

 - Power settings per factory, power is now ignored when auto queuing
 
 

New Features:

 - Much more powerfull unit queuing by expanding the feature from 1 unit to any length of complex queue

 - Settings tab that lets you set the queue for each factory
 
 - Support for every unit
 
 - setting that lets you specify how far into the game you want it to start(won't work well with disconnects with the way the timer is implemented)
 
 Fixed Bugs from the first mod:
 
 - Fixed t1 units getting queued in t2 factorys


as with the original, highly recomended to use with the infinite build default mod

The default queues should be useable for most players, but you can make your own custom ones via settings.


common name list: [ANT,VEHICLE_FAB,SKITTER,SPINNER,INFERNO,GRENADIER,DOX,SLAMMER,GILE,BOT_FAB,STITCH,BLUEHAWK,COLONEL,LOCUST,BOOM,SPARK,HUMMINGBIRD,AIR_FAB,FIREFLY,BUMBLEBEE,NAVAL_FAB,PIRANHA,NARWHAL,ORCA,BARRACUDA,ICARUS,SOLAR_ARRAY,PELICAN,KESTREL,HORSEFLY,ANGEL,WYRM,HORNET,PHOENIX,KAIJU,KRAKEN,STINGRAY,LEVIATHAN,TYPHOON,STRYKER,DRIFTER,LEVELER,STORM,SHELLER,VANGUARD,MANHATTAN,ASTRAEUS,HERMES,AVENGER,ARTEMIS,SSX,OMEGA,ORBITAL_FAB,ADVANCED_BOT_FAB,ADVANCED_VEHICLE_FAB,ADVANCED_AIR_FAB,ADVANCED_NAVAL_FAB,BARNACLE,MEND]

To set your own queue you repeat the format (amount as a number,unitname as common name in all caps,priority as F or T) as much as you want

e.g (5,DOX,F,2,SPARK,F)

For those that choose not to customise the default queues are as follows:


	BOT_FAC = 5 dox, 2 sparks

	ADVANCED_BOT_FAC = 3 slammers, 1 bluehawk, 1 GIl-E

	VEHICLE_FAC = 3 ants, 2 infernos, 1 spinner, 1 skitter, 2 ants

	ADVANCED_VEHICLE_FAC = 3 levelers, 2 shellers, 3 levellers, 3 shellers, 1 storm

	AIR_FAC = 1 priority firefly, 2 hummingbird, 1 bumblebee, 2 hummingbird

	ADVANCED_AIR_FAC = 2 phoenix, 2 kestrel, 1 horsefly

	NAVAL_FAC :  2 barracudas, 1 narwhal, 1 Orca,

	ADVANCED_NAVAL_FAC : 1 priority built typhoon, 2 krakens, 1 leviathen

	ORBITAL_LAUNCHER: 1 avenger

	ORBITAL_FACTORY: 10 avengers, 2 artemis
